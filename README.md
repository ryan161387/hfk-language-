# hfk-language-
 * "hfk" language
 * LISENCE : Ryan(c)
 * USEAGE : Nothing in particular just a fun project
 * INSPIRIATION : Inspired from the "brainfck" programming language
 * Contributers : Ryan Nayeraini and no one , yes litrally no one!
 * File extension : [filename].hfk 
 * Feel free to use and modify this code
 * How to use:
 * this language has an array of ints(30000).
 * use '+' to increase the array that the pointer is pointing to.
 * use '-' to decrease the array that the pointer is pointing to. 
 * use '.' to print int 
 * use ',' to print ASCII
 * use '>' to move the pointer forward
 * use '<' to move the pointer backwards
 * use '$' to sum with the after or before array. ex: +>+$<. this code adds the current array that the array points to, to the pointing array before. Output : 2
 * use '/' to devide with the after or before array. ex: ++>+/<. this code devides the current array that the array points to, to the pointing array before. Output : 2 (2/1)
 * use '#' to multiply with the after or before array.ex: ++>+/<. this code devides the current array that the array points to, to the pointing array before. Output : 2 (2*1)
 * lastly for loops use '[]'. Use the opening bracket to start the while loop and the closing onr to close it.
 * The loop can contain the above commands except nested loops (whiles)
 * If the pointer is moving or not (it does not matter) in the while , the loop continues until the array that the pointer is pointing to  is less than '0'
